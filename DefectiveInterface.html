            <p>Have you ever been so frustrated with a program you're using, that you've found yourself getting angry at... a computer? I mean, getting emotional with a computer is no joke and it really does happen. Whether its the average Joe yelling at his monitor because his show on Hulu isn't loading quick enough or a Mac user blaming everything on the PC, sometimes it simply feels like our applications aren't doing what we want them to do.</p>
            <p>The functionality of this project is to basically have an application that does what you don't want it to do. A mismatch between our conceptual models of how an interface should function and what the system actually executes. This was inspired by the days when I'd try to teach myself various Adobe software. I remember being overwhelmed by an immense array of buttons and frustrated with my method of trial and error. I still feel as though I've only used a fraction of the tools available on Adobe software, although I'm almost certain that there are a ton of other functions embedded under all of the layers of information.</p>
